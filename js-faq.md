1. Describe event bubbling/propogation?
2. Explain event delegation?
3. Explain javascript Event loop with some example?
4. Explain few Common Security Issues with Ajax. or limitations of Using Ajax on a Web Page?
- Security, SEO search engine indexing, user experience, accessibility issues, browser integration, response time concerns, SEO, 

5. What is the difference between .call() and .apply()?
- .call() is used when the number of the function’s arguments are known to the programmer
 .apply() is used when the number is not known

6. Which are the two methods used for cross domain Ajax calls?
- There are two methods used to transfer data between the two more more security domains:
- CORS – Cross Origin Resource Sharing and it works with the HTTP web browsers. It’s a mechanism supported in HTML5 that manages XMLHttpRequest access to a domain different.
- JSONP – JSON with Padding which works with the HTTP GET and on legacy browsers

7. How to Optimize JavaScript Execution? Any JS performance tunning tools used in the past?
- Badly-timed or long-running JavaScript is a common cause of performance issues


8. what metrics do we look at building RIA app?
- performance, 
- size - compiled js file code
- lines of code

9. Tell me ES6 features which you worked in daily coding?
10. When my website is slow. Walk me through diagnosing and fixing it. What are some performance optimizations people use, and when should they be used?

11. Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?

12. Name 3 ways to decrease page load. (perceived or actual load time)

13. Explain the purpose of each of the HTTP request types when used with a RESTful web service.
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, HEAD, Connect.
- HEAD, GET, OPTIONS and TRACE) are defined as safe methods

14. Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocols. Which type of protocol is HTTP? Explain your answer.
- A stateless communications protocol treats each request as an independent transaction.a stateful communications protocol is one in which the responder maintains “state” information (session data, identity, status, etc.) across multiple requests from the same source.
- HTTP is a stateless protocol. HTTP does not require a server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests.

15. What is Long polling, how does it work, what is the main drawback of using long polling? Which HTML5 feature is the best alternative to long polling? 
- Long polling is a web application development pattern used to emulate pushing data from the server to client.
- In HTML5, a useful alternative to long polling is using a WebSocket. A WebSocket is a protocol for providing full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection.

16. Which are the two methods used for cross-domain Ajax calls?
- There are two methods used to transfer data between the two more security domains:

- CORS – Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and it works with the HTTP web browsers. It’s a mechanism supported in HTML5 that manages XMLHttpRequest access to a domain different.
- JSONP – JSON with Padding which works with the HTTP GET and on legacy browsers

17. What is a Promise?
- A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future

18. How to Optimize JavaScript Execution? Any JS performance tuning tools used in the past?
- Badly-timed or long-running JavaScript is a common cause of performance issues.

19. How will you explain closures in JavaScript? When are they used?
- A closure is a locally declared variable related to a function which stays in memory when the function has returned.

20. List types Natively supported by JSON?
- JSON supports Objects, Arrays, Primitives (strings, numbers, boolean values (true/false), null) data types


21. What is the difference between JSON and JSONP?
- JSON: JSON is a simple data format used for communication medium between different systems
- JSONP: It is a methodology for using that format with cross-domain ajax requests while not being affected by same origin policy issue.


22. Does JavaScript support automatic type conversion?
- Yes JavaScript does support automatic type conversion, it is the common way of type conversion used by JavaScript developers

27. What is a closure?
28. How does prototypal inheritance work, and how is it different from classical inheritance? (this is not a useful question IMO, but a lot of people like to ask it)

29. What is event bubbling and how does it work? 
30. Describe a few ways to communicate between a server and a client. Describe how a few network protocols work at a high level (IP, TCP, HTTP/S/2, UDP, RTC, DNS, etc.)
31. what is REST stands for? 
- Representational State Transfer
32. If my website is slow. Walk me through diagnosing and fixing it. What are some performance optimizations people use, and when should they be used?
